Code-Tanks is a programming game where players create their own tanks that are then placed into an arena to compete against each other in a battle for survival. The game is designed to be easy to learn, but also challenging to master, making it a fun and engaging way for programmers to test and improve their skills.

Players write code to control the behavior and actions of their tanks. The tanks have sensors that allow them to sense their environment and the other tanks in the arena, as well as actuators that allow them to move and fire at other tanks.

The game engine is responsible for handling the physics of the arena, the collision detection, and the scoring. It also calls the "run" method of the player-defined class to update the tank's behavior.

Code-Tanks is a game of strategy, and players must think about how their tank will move and fire in the arena to survive and cause damage to other tanks. They can also analyze the code of the winning tanks to learn from their strategies and improve their own tanks.
